# Calculator App

The Calculator App is a simple graphical calculator built using the tkinter library in Python. It provides basic arithmetic operations, square root, and clear functionalities to perform calculations.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Square root calculation
- Clear current entry or entire expression
- Error handling for invalid input or calculations
- User-friendly interface with colorful buttons

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Run the script by executing the Python file.
3. The Calculator App window will appear with a display area and various buttons.
4. Click on the buttons to input numbers and perform calculations.
5. The result will be displayed in the entry area.

## User Guide

1. **Number Buttons (0-9)**: Click on the number buttons to input the corresponding digits.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Use the following buttons to perform arithmetic operations:
   - `+` (Addition)
   - `-` (Subtraction)
   - `*` (Multiplication)
   - `/` (Division)

3. **Square Root**: To calculate the square root of a number, follow these steps:
   - Enter the number in the entry area.
   - Click on the `√` button.
   - The result will be displayed in the entry area.

4. **Clear Entry (CE)**: To clear the current entry, click on the `CE` button.

5. **Clear All (C)**: To clear the entire expression, click on the `C` button.

6. **Decimal Point**: To input decimal numbers, click on the `.` button. Only one decimal point is allowed per entry.

7. **Result Button (=)**: To perform the calculation, click on the `=` button. The result will be displayed in the entry area.

## Example

Suppose you want to calculate the square root of a number and perform some basic arithmetic operations. Follow these steps:

1. Enter the number: `25`
2. Click on the `√` button. The result `5.0` will be displayed.
3. Perform arithmetic operations as needed. For example:
   - `5 + 3`: Click `5`, `+`, `3`, and `=`. The result `8.0` will be displayed.
   - `8 * 2`: Click `*`, `2`, and `=`. The result `16.0` will be displayed.

## Customization

The Calculator App is a basic implementation of a calculator. You can customize and enhance the application based on your specific requirements. For instance:

- You can modify the appearance by changing the font, button colors, and layout.
- You may add more advanced mathematical functions like trigonometric functions, logarithms, etc.
- Improve error handling to provide more informative error messages.
- Implement keyboard support for numerical input and basic operations.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code to suit your needs.
